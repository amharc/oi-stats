Olympiad in Informatics statistics -- a project for the Databases course @ MIMUW

This is a simple website written using the Yesod framework. It supports:
* fetching and automatic parsing of the results of the Polish Olympiad in Informatics (http://oi.edu.pl)
* viewing the results of a particular stage
* performing arbitrarily complex queries (such as "show all the contestants of the 3rd stage of the 20th OI, that got more than 200 points in the 2nd stage of the 19th OI, but did not compete in the 18th OI")
* merging schools and cities (alternative spellings, typos, abbreviations, ...)
* displaying the contestants' cities on a map

Unfortunately, my database account on the MIMUW server has been removed, so the live website is no longer available.
